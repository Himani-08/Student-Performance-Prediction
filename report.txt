Title: Student Performance Prediction Report

Contents:

1. Abstract:

This project leverages a Random Forest Classifier to predict student performance using features like study time and parental education. The predictions aim to help educators and parents understand factors influencing student outcomes.

2.Introduction:

Academic performance prediction is critical for early intervention. This project integrates machine learning and a GUI to make performance prediction accessible.

3.Methodology:

 - Data Preprocessing: 

     - Filled missing values using forward fill.
     - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., parental education).

- Model Selection:

     - Random Forest Classifier was chosen for its robustness and accuracy.

 - Training:

     - Data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%).
     - Features were scaled using StandardScaler.

4.Results:

The application provides a predicted performance category for the input student data. Accuracy depends on the dataset.

5.Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in educational analytics. Future work could include more features like attendance or extracurricular involvement.
